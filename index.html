However, the D compiler has been able to write code with clever prompting for years! While the instructions aren't as basic as plain English, the results are exact and specific, and can save you hours of work and chasing bugs! This talk will showcase some examples of how to use the compiler as your minion, and the pros and cons of these techniques.

            <p><b>Abstract:</b> D makes for an excellent language to solve problems. As researchers, we have a seemingly never-ending list of problems we would like to uncover answers to. In this talk, we will explore how D is used in one cybersecurity research lab as our go-to language. We will show how D has made for a fun experience that allowed us to quickly solve a wide range of interesting problems in the cybersecurity space. We will show some exciting hacks in the process of being reviewed for academic publication. At the end of this talk, you will have some ideas for how to incorporate D into your research. We will end by talking a little bit about how using your favorite programming language for research contributes to a "soft but loud" advocacy.

			<ul>
					<li>From New York City you can take the <a href="https://www.mta.info/agency/metro-north-railroad">Metro North</a> from Grand Central Station to New Haven in under 2 hours to Union Station in New Haven</li>
					<li>From New York City you can take the <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/home">amtrak</a> from Moynihan Station to New Haven in around 90-minutes, or even faster with the Accela trains to Union Station in New Haven.</li>
					<li>From Boston, MA you can take also take the <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/home">amtrak</a> from South Station, Backbay, or Route 128 to New Haven around 2 hours, or slightly faster with the Accela trains to Union Station in New Haven.</li>
					<li>From Providence, RI you can take also take the <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/home">amtrak</a> from Providence Station in about 90 minutes or slightly faster with the Accela trains to Union Station in New Haven.</li>
					<li>From Hartford, Ct. you can take the <a href="https://hartfordline.com/fares-schedules/">Hartford Line</a> on the CT Rail from Hartford to Union Station in about 60 minutes or less.</li>
			</ul>

      <h1>Hackathon</h1>

			<p>Day 2 of the symposium will feature a 'hackathon' to work with the D programming language. This page will list various 'ideas' and 'starter code' to work on. It is not a requirement to work on one of these projects, but we figured it would be helpful if you were scratching your head figuring out what to do for the day. These projects may also help you 'team up' and meet some other D hackers as well.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Note: Project starter packs will be updated here closer to the date of the event.</li>

      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Q: How do I register?
					<ul><li> A: See the eventbrite page at the top of the website</li></ul>
				</li>
				<li>Q: Do I need to be a master of the D programming language before attending?
					<ul><li> A: No! All skill levels are welcomed.</li></ul>
				</li>
				<li>Q: Why should I attend?
					<ul><li> A: For D programmers this is an awesome opportunity to further your skills. If you're not familiar with the D programming language, this is an excellent time to learn about a new language and various computer science topics. At the very least, you will get to meet and mingle with other folks excited about programming.</li></ul>
				</li>
				<li>Q: Is this similar to DConf?
					<ul><li> A: <a href="https://dconf.org/">DConf</a> is the annual conference (usually held in London) that runs for several days. It is similar in spirit, and you should consider attending DConf (usually in Aug/Sept) if you have fun at this event!</li></ul>
				</li>
				<li>Q: I have  never used D, but I am a programming language enthusiast -- where do I start?
          <ul><li> A: I have a whole playlist of videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvv0ScY6vfd9Fso-3cB4CGnSlW0E4btJV">here</a> on the D language. I would recommend starting with this <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPeYI12A6CY&list=PLvv0ScY6vfd9Fso-3cB4CGnSlW0E4btJV&index=142"">lecture (75 minutes)</a> if you want more depth, or if you're pressed for time, a shorter <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJf0etigg7o&list=PLvv0ScY6vfd9Fso-3cB4CGnSlW0E4btJV&index=138"">38-minute video</a> motivating 'why D is my 2^x language' for programming.</li></ul>
